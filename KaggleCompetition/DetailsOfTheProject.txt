This project has been done for a kaggle competition deployed at 
https://www.kaggle.com/code/sahilali744/less-women-in-stem-if-yes-why-so
This work was done to explore the hypothesis (do women choose the same pltforms and products preferred by men?) by using the provided data set by kaggle.
The respective hypothesis was proposed to see the factors behind less number of women in STEM sectors.
The project was perceived like a research work and written in a book like format to make it easier for even a newbie to undrstand the concepts and codes' purposes.
The overview of the work done has also been elaborated in a small video on https://youtu.be/JkBxprtIxjI
